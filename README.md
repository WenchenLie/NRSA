# Nonlinear Response Spectrum Analysis (NRSA)

## 1. Introduction
**NRSA** is a Python program for **Nonlinear Response Spectrum Analysis (NRSA)** of single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) systems. It supports two types of analysis: **Constant Ductility Analysis (CDA)** and **Constant Strength Analysis (CSA)**.

Users can define custom inelastic materials based on the OpenSees material library. Nonlinear response spectra can be obtained using either CDA or CSA, including the constant ductility spectrum (*R*-*Î¼*-*T* relationship), ductility demand spectrum, etc.

To meet the demands of large-scale computations, the program supports multi-processing and provides a graphical user interface to visualize the progress of the analysis.

## 2. Usage
Use the example scripts `main_cda.py` and `main_csa.py` to perform CDA and CSA analyses, respectively.
